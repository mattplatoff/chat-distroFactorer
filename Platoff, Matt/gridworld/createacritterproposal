create a critter proposal:
my critter will be a hanibal critter and will move one space closer to which ever other critter is closest to it with in a five space radius.  
Then when it catches up to the other critter the hanibal critter will eat it.  
other actors in the grid will behave as they normally do .
 hanibal critter will extend critter.
 hanibal critter will override:
getActors()
will get all actors with in a 5 space radius
processActors()
will get the location of the closest actor and save it as an instance feild
all critters with in one space of this critter.
getMoveLocations()
will return one space in the direction of the closest critter
