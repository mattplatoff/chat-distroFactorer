create a critter proposal:
my critter will be a hanibal critter and will move one space closer to which ever other critter is closest to it with in a five space radius.  
Then when it catches up to the other critter the hanibal critter will eat it.  
other actors in the grid will behave as they normally do .
 hanibal critter will extend critter.
 hanibal critter will override:
getActors()
processActors()
getMoveLocations()
selectMoveLocations()
