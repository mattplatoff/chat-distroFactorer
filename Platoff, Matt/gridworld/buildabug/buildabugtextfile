My bug drops three flowers as it moves rather than one.  
When one music bug runs into another bug it launches the default browser on the computer and plays music.
the bug runs around until it finds another bug. then it eats it.
I chose to over ride canMove and move because my music bug follows the same basic path as a regular bug, however it can move to diffrent spots than a bug I.E. over other actors.
i chose to over ride move so the bug could drop three flowers and launch the video that it does.
